# Langchain_Q-A
This project is a Q&amp;A chatbot built with Python, LangChain, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5, deployed in a Streamlit web app. It honed my skills in natural language processing, API integration, and web development. I learned secure environment management, NLP model deployment, and user-friendly interface creation.
